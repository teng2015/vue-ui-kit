# vue-starter-kit

A boilerplate using Vue.js, Gulp, Sass and Browserify, with a bunch of bulit-in tools and components that make your life easier.

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the vue-starter-kit repository and install the dependencies:

### Clone vue-starter-kit

Clone the angular-seed repository using git:

    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/panteng/vue-starter-kit.git <your-project-name>

### Install Dependencies

    npm install
    
This may take several minutes. Behind the scenes it will also call `bower install`. You should find two new folders in your project.

 - `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the gulp tasks.
 - `bower_components` - contains all frontend packages.
 
### Start Developing

    gulp dev

or just
    
    gulp
