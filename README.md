## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the vue-ui-kit repository and install the dependencies:

### Clone vue-ui-kit

Clone the vue-ui-kit repository using git:

    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/panteng/vue-ui-kit.git <your-project-name>

### Install Dependencies

    npm install
    
This may take several minutes. Behind the scenes it will also call `bower install`. You should find two new folders in your project.

 - `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the gulp tasks and frontend dependencies.
 - `bower_components` - contains frontend packages that cannot be installed by npm.
 
### Start Developing

    gulp dev

or just
    
    gulp
