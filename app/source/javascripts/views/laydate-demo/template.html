<p>Laydate is a directive that uses <a href="http://laydate.layui.com/">layDate</a> as datetime picker.</p>
<p><a href="http://laydate.layui.com/">layDate</a> supports only Chinese and has some bugs. I am looking for an alternative to it.</p>
<p>Click to pick a time.</p>
<input type="text" v-laydate="time" data-istime="true">
